Tic Tac Toe: A friendly competition

This application allows the user to create an account and sign in to play rounds of Tic Tac Toe. In addition to playing Tic Tac Toe, you might notice that variables 'X' and 'O' have their own color schemes.

Planning Story

I am going to start by creating a sign-up form and a sign-in form and connect them to their respective APIs. After finishing these, I will create a sign-out button and a password-change form, both also connecting to their respective APIs. The next thing I will do is add a button which will start a new game, updating through it's updategames API. Whenever a new game starts, its board should reset. In addition, there will be another button that gives you the number of games played on the account the user is logged in on. After finishing all the logic, I will move on the working with the CSS and adding a simple color scheme to make it approachable.

User Schemes

- As a user, I want to be able to sign-up and log-in
- As a user, I want to be able to create a new game every time I click a button
- As a user, I want have a colorful website so I don't get bored
- As a user, I want to see how many games I have played
- As a user, I don't want to see any bugs when playing

Technologies Used

- jQuery
- JavaScript
- CSS

Unsolved Problems

- Still need to add the player wins/ties to the `Get Games` button
- Need to add more customization to the site, such as the user being able to change the colors of their board and the background
